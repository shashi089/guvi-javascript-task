1) Difference between browser js and Node js

  * In browser most of the time interact with DOM, or other platform API's like Cookies. But those do not exist in 
    Node.js. Because Nodejs dont have the document,window and all other objects that are provided by the browser.

  * Browser dont have all the nice API's that Nodejs provides through its modules , like the filesystem access functionality.

  * Browser is bit slow to upgrade but Nodejs is so fast

  * In Browser we can use babel to transform our code to be ES5-compatible before shipping it to the browser but in Node.js  we won't need that

  * Node.js uses the CommonJS module system, while in the browser we are starting to see the ES Modules standard being implemented.
